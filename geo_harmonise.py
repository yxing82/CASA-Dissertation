"""
geo_harmonise.py  —  Single source of truth for 2011<->2021 MSOA geography harmonisation.

Both preprocessing notebooks (London-only 0615 and national-frame 0622) import this so the
two panels are guaranteed to sit on the *same* 982-MSOA, 2011-based geography.

Policy
------
- Unchanged (U): 2021 code maps to the identical 2011 code.
- Split (S): each 2021 child maps up to its single 2011 parent (exact aggregation).
- Merge (M): the 2011 parents that fuse into one 2021 code are collapsed into a single
  "best-fit" combined zone, keyed by the LOWEST member 2011 code (kept as a real code so it
  still joins to the IMD table and the 2011 geojson). The combined zone carries the
  population-weighted IMD of its members (handled in each notebook by relabelling the
  LSOA->MSOA mapping before aggregation), and is treated as ONE unit in both census years.
